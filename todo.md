# todo for third iteration:
1. Make task (abstract) class with specific tasks as subclasses. To complete a task just set its boolean isCompleted to true. 
Also remove workstation from tasks. Make car use only 1 set of Tasks and check if all tasks are completed (with boolean)
to getUncompletedTasks (and completedTasks)
